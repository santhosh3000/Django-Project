## Part 3
Create a website that uses a Covid-19 api from https://covid19api.com/ comparing two countries' confirmed cases.
1. Used matplotlib to create the chart
2. I compared Sweden and Norway, I did this because currently Sweden has no restrictions on citizens in terms of social distancing, compared to its neighbor Norway who has strict social distancing measures in place.
